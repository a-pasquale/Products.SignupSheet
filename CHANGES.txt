0.2.0 Beta
----------
Andreas Jung and Radim Novotny contributed significantly to this release.

- added Portuguese Brasilian translation. Thanks Vitor Reis.
- added 'view registrants' that displays current registrants status and allows for confirming and editing registrants
- added i18n support for templates
- added German translation
- updated tests to pass
- updated i18n
- Because thank_you_page and email_response fields were changed from TextField
  to ZPTField it is necessary to manually run migration code from 
  Extensions/migrate method fixZPTFields. This method will read
  old values from these two fields and store the same value in new format.
  WARNING: if you don't run migration you will get AttributeError: read
  when accessing old SignupSheet objects  
- It is possible to generate HTML emails
- workflow script sendInitialEmail is called *before* the transition,
  because anonymous can access registrant object only in 'new' state.
  If script will be called after transition, Registrant.sendNotificationMail
  method won't have access to registrant object. Access is required due to 
  rendering templates from ZPTField.
- removed signupsheet_email_* templates
- Introduced TALESField and TemplateFields dependecy. SignupSheet uses
  these two fields for scripting thank_you_page, confirmation and 
  notification email (subject and message).
  Syntax is described in field help text::

     context = SignupSheet
     options/registrant = current Registrant object
     
- added notifyEmail field to signupsheet schema. It allows to send notification 
  about new registrant to some email address.
- removed registration of SignupSheet.css from portal_css
- it is possible to use options/computed_text in email template now
- use getSiteEncoding if available
- additional i18n work (signupsheet.py - schema)
- improved i18n catalogs, added Czech translation
- do not depend on Kupu in install code
- replaced dtml templates with ZPT with i18n
- use base_view for SignupSheet and simplified signupsheet_view template
